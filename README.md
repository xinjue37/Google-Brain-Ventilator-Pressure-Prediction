* This is a project developed in undergraduate Year 2 - Semester 1.
* The repository consists
  - Jupyter notebook file that contains code about data analysis of the dataset, data pre-processing, building & training of Machine Learning model (KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN, Bidirectional LSTM, Bidirectional GRU) and statistical model(ARIMA, VAR) to solve the Covid-19 ventilator control problem
* Essentially, in this repository, we are solving the time-series data forecasting problem
* The data that we used was obtained from [Kaggle -Google Brain - Ventilator Pressure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ventilator-pressure-prediction/data)
